# Data-Viz-and-Dashboards-w-Excel-Cognos

## Overview

This repository showcases two data visualization projects developed using IBM Cognos Analytics and Microsoft Excel. The projects demonstrate a range of skills from basic chart creation to advanced visualization techniques and the development of interactive dashboards. These visualizations are designed to enhance data-driven storytelling and support decision-making processes.

## Project 1: Interactive Dashboards with IBM Cognos Analytics

### Description
In this project, I developed dynamic dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics. The dashboards transform complex datasets into clear, intuitive visuals that reveal key insights and trends. They include interactive features allowing users to explore data at various levels of detail, supporting in-depth analysis and decision-making.

### Key Features
- **KPI Dashboards**: Track key performance indicators and metrics.
- **Operational Reports**: Provide detailed insights into operational data.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Enable users to interact with data through filters and drill-downs.

### Learning Outcomes
- Gained proficiency in using Cognos for building and sharing interactive dashboards.
- Enhanced understanding of the role of visuals in communicating data-driven stories.

## Project 2: Data Visualization with Excel

### Description
This project focuses on using Excel for creating a range of visualizations, from basic charts to advanced visual representations. The goal was to demonstrate how different types of charts can effectively convey data stories and insights.

### Key Visualizations
- **Basic Charts**: Line graphs, bar graphs, and pie charts to represent simple data distributions.
- **Advanced Charts**: 
  - **Treemaps**: Visualize hierarchical data.
  - **Sparklines**: Show trends in a compact format.
  - **Histograms**: Display frequency distributions.
  - **Scatter Plots**: Highlight relationships between variables.
  - **Filled Map Charts**: Represent geographical data visually.

### Learning Outcomes
- Mastered the creation of basic and advanced charts in Excel.
- Developed an understanding of how different chart types can effectively tell a data-driven story.
- Learned to construct and share interactive dashboards using Excel.

## Conclusion

These projects have provided a comprehensive understanding of data visualization techniques and tools. They have equipped me with the skills to create effective visual analytics solutions, tailored to different business needs. The projects underscore the importance of choosing the right visualization type to communicate insights clearly and effectively.
